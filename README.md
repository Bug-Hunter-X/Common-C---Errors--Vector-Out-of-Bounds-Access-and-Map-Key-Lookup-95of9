This repository contains examples of two common errors in C++: accessing a vector beyond its bounds and accessing a non-existent key in a map.  The `bug.cpp` file demonstrates the errors, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides corrected versions.  These examples highlight the importance of careful index checking when working with vectors and handling potential missing keys in maps to prevent unexpected behavior and program crashes.
